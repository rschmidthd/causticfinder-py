# causticfinder-py

Released here by Robert W. Schmidt rschmidthd@gmail.com

Open source implementation of the analytical method by Witt (1990,1991) in gravitational microlensing to
find the locations of critical curves and caustics for an abritrary number of stars.

This code is a translation to a python jupyter notebook of the program Caustic Finder originally released under
the GNU public license here: causticfinder.sourcefourge.net (originally written in C). The code was extended
to also allow for stars with different masses.
